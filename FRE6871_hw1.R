# Max score 50pts

# Please write in this file the R code needed to perform the tasks below, 
# rename it to your_name_hw1.R
# and send this file to Jaimin Doshi (jbd316@nyu.edu)


##################################
# 1. (15pts) Create the character string "y = x1 + x2 + x3" from 
# characters "x", "y", "=", "+", and the vector 1:3, using the function 
# paste() with a collapse string,

### write your code here



##################################
# 2. (25pts) create a numeric vector of length 10 containing random normal variates, using rnorm(),

### write your code here


######
# assign the names: "el1, ..., el10", to the vector elements, 
# using the function paste(), with the proper "sep" argument, 
# (you can't use function c())

### write your code here



######
# change the vector names to: "num1, ..., num10",  
# using the function gsub(), (you can't use functions c() or paste())

### write your code here



######
# extract the element named "num4",

### write your code here



######
# change the vector names to: "my.num1, ..., my.num10", 
# using the function paste(), with the proper "sep" argument,

### write your code here



######
# change the first vector element name back to: "num1", 
# using the function strsplit(), with the proper "split" argument,
# hint: strsplit() returns a list, subset it using [[1]],

### write your code here





##################################
# 3. (10pts) create a numeric vector of length 30 containing random normal variates, 
# using rnorm(),

### write your code here



######
# get the indices of the elements that are greater than or equal to -0.5 and less than 1.0,

### write your code here



######
# extract the elements that are greater than or equal to -0.5 and less than 1.0,

### write your code here



######
# calculate the mean and standard deviation of the vector elements,

### write your code here



######
# combine this vector with the vector "31:33" inot a single vector,

### write your code here
